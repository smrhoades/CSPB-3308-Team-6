Day/Time of Weekly Team Meeting: Wednesdays 6 pm MDT-USA / 7 pm CDT-USA / 8am CST-China (Thurs)

Vision statement: Connect through messaging

Motivation:
- Create a means of exchanging messages between users
- Collaborating to learn new tools and processes ( HTML, Javascript, Python, SQL, network traffic )
- Simple MVP with flexibility to add incremental features

Risks to project completion, possibly including:
- No prior experience working with these team members
- Minimal experience working with network traffic
- Scope creep
  
Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
- Using Agile, Scrum, Discord, scheduled meetings, communication structures
- At least one team member with some experience with network traffic
- Use Python libraries
- Focus on MVP first before additional features

Development method:
- Agile + Scrum with 1 week sprints
- Asyncronous check-in via Discord over weekends
- Rotating Scrum Master position
- Rotate team members across tech stack
- Shared GitHub repository
- JIRA board for organization
